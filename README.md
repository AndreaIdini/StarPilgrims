## Project description

## Game Mechanics

### Resources

- Energy, with Power and Energy battery capacity
- Matter
- Credits

Expansions cost Matter + Credits, Consume or produce Energy and Matter, maybe Credits.

Credits are earned through services (such as hosting people or experiments), especially early game

Services consume matter and energy.

Missions and Events help or hinder.

Evaluate logarithmic curve for credits earning in factory in function of the number of humans, maybe difficult to balance

### Costs:
	
- Solar Panel: 1KW = 10kg + 10k Credits
- Matter: 1kg = 1k Credits
- 1 Human: Gain: 20k Credits / day; Costs: 10kg/d; 100kWh/d = 4.1 kW
- Upkeep: X per module.

### Build:

Buiding takes time, but is reduced by log_2(number of humans+1). It needs a human to build things, and having more humans help but progressively less. 3 humans, the starting living quarter capacity, gives factor 2.

### Launch and orbits:

Launches of matter and humans need to be planned in advance, they have a cost in credits and a given capacity.

At a certain points it will be possible to change orbit, this will change the rate at which drones can accumulate matter but also cost and time needed for orbital launches, needing a more self-sufficient outpost but allowing for more resource accumulation.
	

## Story snippets

### Intro

People have dreamt of the stars since time immemorial

[...]

This is the story of the last human migration. This is its first step.

### Tutorial

Hello, welcome to Space Station 1. Don't be startled! We needed to jumpstart the waking process and you might miss many operating parameters. I'm here to provide guidance!

Space Station 1 (S1) is the first station of the Space United Combine (SUC). You are the AI that has to attend to this branch of SUC in the generational effort of making a self-sustaining space environment for human habitation. Your final mission is even grander, it will become clear with time.

------

There are three fundamental resource types:
	- Energy, both stored and power production. We need it to keep things running, and basically everything costs energy up here. Careful that not having enough energy will increase the risk of malfunctions!
	- Matter. For now you'll need to pay credits for matter to be delivered from Earth, but we need to think of a better way to satisfy the basic needs.
	- Credits. Right now you need credits to maintain your upkeep, order Matter, and expand. You can obtain credits hosting humans and providing other services.
	
Humans need oxygen, food and energy to survive. Alas, this is inefficient but necessary! You primary purpose is to make human flourish up here, if a human were to die because of lack of resources you and your station will be dismantled and will be a terrible hit to our program!

- **The thermal power to be dissipated** from the reactor would be about 1 MW. From the Stefan Boltzmann Law, the area of the radiator would be about 50 m2 and the mass approximately 500 kg. This seems quite reasonable.

- However, even this pales in comparison to Voyager 1, which was launched on Sept. 5th, 1977 and reached the Asteroid Belt on Dec. 10th, 1977 – a total of 96 days. And then there was the Voyager 2 probe, which launched 15 days after Voyager 1 (on Sept. 20th), but still managed to arrive on the same date – which works out to a total travel time of 81 days.
